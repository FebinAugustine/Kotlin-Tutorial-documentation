## What is Kotlin

Kotlin is a programming language that is a modern take on Java. It is a statically typed language with type inference, which means that the type of a variable is inferred from its initial value.

## Basics

### Variables

- Variables in Kotlin
  - val
  - var
- Type Inference
- Null Safety
  - Non-nullable by Default
  - Nullable Types
  - Safe Call Operator (?.)
  - Elvis Operator (?:)
  - Non-null Asserted Call Operator (!!)

### Data Types

- Numeric Types
- Boolean Type
- Character Type
- String Type
- Array Type
- Collection Types
- Type Conversions
- Conclusion

### Operators

- Assignment Operators
- Arithmetic Operators
- Increment and Decrement Operators
- Comparison (Relational) Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators (Member Functions)
- Range Operators
- Membership Operators
- Elvis Operator (?:)
- Safe Call Operator (?.) and Non-null Asserted Call (!!)
- Type Check and Cast Operators
- Operator Overloading

### Control Flow

- Conditional Expressions (if and when)
- Loop Constructs
- Jump Expressions

### Functions:

- Basic Function Declaration
- Function Return Types
- Single-Expression Functions
- Function Parameters
- Function Scope and Visibility
- Extension Functions
- Higher-Order Functions and Lambdas
- Inline Functions
- Tail-Recursive Functions (tailrec)
